### CatVision.io

CatVision.io is where you **manage** your **API keys** and connected devices. You can view screens of your devices on this portal or you can do it with the CatVision Screen component. Either way you will first need to **register at CatVision.io** ([https://catvision.io/register](https://catvision.io/register))

#### New Product

After you register you will be prompted to "**Add new product**". You can understand a **Product** as a *namespace* for your applications.

**E. g.:** Let's say you have two applications: *"Auction for Buyers"* and *"Auction for Sellers"*. Then you could create a **Product** named *Auction*.
