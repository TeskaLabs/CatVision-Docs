# Welcome to CatVision.io manual

CatVision.io is a product that provides an easy and secure remote access to a screen of your mobile application aka the screen share and/or a remote control of the mobile application.

Users of a mobile application equipped by CatVision.io can get a real-time online support without being asked what is currently on their screen. An application can be used remotely without a person to be physically present at the hardware that the application runs on. For example, this can be very useful in use with room control tablets or Android IoT devices.

Customer or technical support uses a web browser to display a shared screen of the mobile device and control the app remotely. They can use the [CatVision.io](https://app.catvision.io/) web portal or a _CatVision.io Display_ integrated to their common tools such as CRM.
